# SIMBA

`SIMBA` is a Python software package that numerically solves time-dependent chemical reaction networks for astrophysical environments. The code is optimized for modeling complex chemical evolution in settings such as the interstellar medium (ISM), molecular clouds, and protoplanetary disks.

## Installation

`SIMBA` can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install simba_chem
```
