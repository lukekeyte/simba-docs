# Using the Code

## Overview

`SIMBA` is implemented entirely in Python, prioritizing code clarity while achieving acceptable performance through targeted optimization. The code is structured into several modules that handle distinct aspects of the chemical modelling. This modular design improves maintainability by separating distinct functionalities, facilitates testing by isolating components, and allows users to extend individual components without affecting the rest of the codebase. 

The core data structures are implemented using Python's dataclass framework, which provides a concise way to create classes focused on data storage with built-in validation. The primary dataclasses are:

* ```Species```: Contains arrays of abundances, masses, and charges for chemical species, alongside their names
* ```Reactions```: Stores reaction networks including reactants, products, rate coefficient parameters, and temperature limits
* ```Gas``` and ```Dust```: Hold physical properties such as temperatures and densities for each phase
* ```Environment```: Contains parameters describing the local conditions like radiation field strength, extinction, and ionization rates
* ```Parameters```: Stores simulation settings and physical constants

Each dataclass includes validation methods that ensure physical constraints are met (e.g., positive temperatures, valid abundance ranges) and type checking.

Rate coefficients are calculated using a type-based classification system that is deliberately compatible with the established ```DALI``` code [(Bruderer et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012A%26A...541A..91B/abstract), [2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...559A..46B/abstract)). By adopting the same reaction type identifiers, ```SIMBA``` can seamlessly use chemical networks developed for ```DALI``` without requiring reformatting or conversion. This design choice facilitates network validation and comparison of results between codes, and a detailed benchmarking of ```SIMBA``` against ```DALI``` is presented in our code overview paper. While the code currently reads networks in the ```DALI``` format, the modular structure allows users to easily implement additional parsers for other network formats, provided they map the reactions to the appropriate type identifiers. An example network (first presented in [Keyte et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023NatAs...7..684K/abstract)) is provided with the code.

The core solver is implemented in the ```Simba``` class, which manages the chemical network integration. This class employs the ```scipy.integrate.solve_ivp``` routine with the backward differentiation formula (BDF) method, which is particularly suitable for the stiff systems characteristic of astrochemical networks. Performance-critical numerical routines are optimized using ```numba``` just-in-time compilation. This includes the calculation of chemical derivatives and the Jacobian matrix. The derivatives function computes formation and destruction rates for each species, while the Jacobian calculation is optimized for the typically sparse structure of chemical networks, where most species interact with only a small subset of the total network.

Self-shielding calculations are handled by a dedicated module that pre-loads tabulated shielding factors during initialization. For $\small{\text{CO}}$ and $\small{\text{N}}_2$, this module implements interpolation routines that operate on the tabulated data, while $\small{\text{H}}_2$ and $\small{\text{C}}$ self-shielding are computed using their analytical approximations. 

The code also includes comprehensive analysis and visualization capabilities through a dedicated analysis module and graphical user interface. This provides plotting functions for species abundances and reaction rates over time, as well as tools for investigating chemical pathways and network properties. Data can also be exported in standard formats for further analysis.

## Input File

``SIMBA`` reads its configuration from a simple text-based input file (`.dat`) that defines the physical conditions, environmental parameters, and runtime settings for the simulation.

### Example Input
Here's a representative input file with typical values:

```
# SIMBA Input File

n_gas          = 1.190e+08
n_dust         = 2.498e+05
t_gas          = 1830.8
t_dust         = 148.0
gtd            = 4.763e+02
Av             = 3.136e-01
G_0            = 6.419e+04
Zeta_X         = 5.626e-14
h2_col         = 5.489e+18
self_shielding = True
column         = True
Zeta_CR        = 5e-17
pah_ism        = 0.1
t_chem         = 1e6
network        = 'chemical_network.dat'
```

### Parameter Definitions

| Parameter | Description | Units |
|:----------|:------------|:------|
| `n_gas` | Number density of gas | cm³ |
| `n_dust` | Number density of dust grains | cm³ |
| `t_gas` | Gas temperature | K |
| `t_dust` | Dust grain temperature | K |
| `gtd` | Gas-to-dust number density ratio | dimensionless |
| `Av` | Visual extinction | mag |
| `G_0` | Local FUV field strength in Draine units | ~2.7 x 10⁻³ erg s⁻¹ cm⁻² |
| `Zeta_X` | X-ray ionization rate | s⁻¹ |
| `h2_col` | H₂ column density | cm⁻² |
| `self_shielding` | Enable self-shielding calculations for H₂, N₂, CO, and C | boolean |

### Creating an Input File
You can generate a template input file using the built-in helper function:
```python
import simba_chem as simba
simba.create_input("path/to/save/input_file.dat")    # then modify with your specific parameters
```

<br/><br>

## Chemical Network

The chemical network file specifies the complete set of chemical species, reactions, and rate coefficients that drive the chemical evolution in `SIMBA`. By design, `SIMBA` is configured to read chemical networks with identical format to that of the widely-used `DALI` thermochemical code, enabling direct comparison with published results and facilitating ease-of-use.

### Default Network

A standard chemical network is included with the installation (originally presented in [Keyte et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023NatAs...7..684K/abstract)). You can create a copy of this network using the helper function:

```python
import simba_chem as simba
simba.create_network("directory/to/save/network/")
```
The copied network file can then be modified to include additional reactions, adjusted for specific chemical conditions, or used as a template for creating a new network.

The file follows a structured format with three main sections:
1. A list of elements that form the basic building blocks
2. A comprehensive list of atomic and molecular species, including their properties
3. A detailed list of chemical reactions and their rate coefficients

Correct formatting must be maintained throughout the file, as parsing errors can occur even with minor deviations. The expected structure is detailed in the sections below.

### Alternative Network Formats

`SIMBA` is currently configured to only read `DALI`-format network files. However, support for alternative formats can be added by modifying the code:

1. Create a Python function that reads your network file and returns the following arrays:

    ```python
    def read_custom_network(filename):
        # Your parsing code here
        return (n_elements, elements_name,
                n_species, species_name, species_abu, 
                species_mass, species_charge,
                n_reactions, reactions_educts, reactions_products,
                reactions_reaction_id, reactions_itype,
                reactions_a, reactions_b, reactions_c,
                reactions_temp_min, reactions_temp_max, 
                reactions_pd_data)
    ```

2. Replace the `read_chemnet` function in the `simba_helpers` module with your custom function

3. Ensure your network follows these requirements:
    - Uses the same reaction type IDs as described in this documentation
    - Maintains consistent array shapes and data types
    - Includes all required fields for species and reactions

## Running the Code

### Single-point (0D) models

A single-point model can be run easily with just a few lines of code. See the Quick Start guide for details.

### 1D (+higher dimension) models

```SIMBA``` can be easily extended from single-point (0D) to multi-dimensional models by creating a grid of input parameters and running individual instances for each grid cell. This approach allows you to efficiently model chemical evolution across spatial gradients in density, temperature, radiation field strength, or any other environmental parameter.

Most astrochemical modeling codes implement "static" models, where each grid cell is initialized with identical starting abundances and evolved to the same chemical age. The only differences between cells are the physical parameters (density, temperature, radiation field, etc.). SIMBA readily supports this conventional approach:

[EXAMPLE HERE]

```SIMBA``` offers additional flexibility for modeling systems with time-varying physical conditions. Unlike static models, this approach allows you to track chemical evolution through dynamically changing environments by:

* Running a model with initial physical conditions
* Using the final chemical state as the initial state for the next model
* Updating physical parameters for the next time step
* Repeating to follow the chemical evolution through the changing environment

This capability is particularly valuable for modeling systems undergoing significant physical changes, such as protoplanetary disks with evolving temperature/density profiles, gas parcels moving through varying radiation environments etc. A simple dynamical 1D model is presented in our code overview paper.

## Analysis Tools

The `Analysis` module provides simple plotting routines for visualizing results, including:
* Abundances vs. Time
* Reaction Rates vs. Time 
* Dashboard showing key diagnositics

First, initialize the model, run the simulation, and instantiate the `Analysis` module:

```python
import simba_chem as simba
network = simba.Simba()                          # create an instance of SIMBA
network.init_simba("path/to/input_file.dat")     # initialise the network
network.solve_network()                          # run the solver
analysis = simba.Analysis(network)               # access analysis
```

### Abundances vs. Time
The `plot_abundance()` method generates time-evolution plots for specified chemical species:
```python
analysis.plot_abundance(['CO', 'H2O', 'CH4'])                         
```
[example plot]

### Reaction rates vs. Time
The `plot_reaction_rate()` method generates time-evolution plots for individual reaction rates, taking in a list of reaction IDs (as defined in the chemical network)
```python
analysis.plot_reaction_rate([1, 7, 18, 22])               
```
[example plot]

It can sometimes be useful to plot all the major formation and destruction reactions for a particular species. This can easily be done with a short code, eg:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(15,6), sharey=True)

species = 'CO'

rate_threshold = 1e-14  # only show rates above some threshold

# Find reaction data
species_formation   = []
species_destruction = []

for i in range(0, network.parameters.n_reactions):
    if species in network.reactions.products[i]:
        species_formation.append(i)
    if species in network.reactions.educts[i]:
        species_destruction.append(i)

# Plot formation rates
for i in species_formation:
    if np.max(result['rates'][:,i]) > rate_threshold:
        ax[0].plot(result['time']/network.parameters.yr_sec, result['rates'][:,i], label=result['reaction_labels'][i])

# Plot destruction rates
for i in species_destruction:
    if np.max(result['rates'][:,i]) > rate_threshold:
        ax[1].plot(result['time']/network.parameters.yr_sec, result['rates'][:,i], label=result['reaction_labels'][i])

for j in range(0,2):
    ax[j].set_xscale('log')
    ax[j].set_yscale('log')
    ax[j].legend()
    
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


### Dashboard

**NOTE:** The Dashboard tool is a work-in-progress! Please use at your own risk!

The dashboard displays model parameters and other useful diagnostic plots including:
* Solver statistics
* Quasi steady-states timescales (top 10 most abundant species)
* Abundances vs. time (top 10 most abundant species)
* Reaction rates vs. time  (top 10 most efficient reactions)
* Species correlation matrix
* Final abundances of all species

```python
analysis.plot_dashboard()               
```
[example plot]


### Additional tools

Additional analysis tools (eg. interactive plots, network path analysis) are available in the GUI. Future versions of the code will also include these in the ```Analysis``` module.
